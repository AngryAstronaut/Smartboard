# Smartboard Reconnect Script
This is a Smartboard Reconnect script written in Apple Script
Sometimes the smart service freezes up on a mac while connected to a smartboard. This script kills the service and then relaunches.
I would recommend exporting the script as an app from script editor and give it a nice icon.
